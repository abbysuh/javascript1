// DAY 1 NOTES AND EXAMPLES
//
// /* DECLARE YOUR VARIABLE
//     camelCasing is the best practice is JavaScript
//     Always end a JavaScript statement with a semi-colon
//     Once you declare a variable, you need to define it
//     Make variable names as descriptive as you can, but not really long
//     */
//
// var firstName;
//
// /* DEFINE YOUR VARIABLE
//     Anything in quotes - "" '', is a string
// */
//
// firstName = "Abby";
//
// // DEFINE AND DECLARE YOUR VARIABLE AT THE SAME TIME
//
// var lastName = "McLallin";
//
// /* TEST YOUR CODE IN THE CONSOLE!
//     If you put an error in the codes, the code will immediately stop.
//     First check variable names, then check to see if everything is in the right order.
// */
//
// console.log(firstName, lastName);
//
// //REDEFINING THE VARIABLE
//
// firstName = "Superman"; //Keep quotations consistent "" or ''
// console.log(firstName);
//
// // Single line of code is //, no closing //.
// /* Multi-line comments use
// an asterisk, slash and closed with it */
//
// /*Scope indenting - one tab spacings
//   When you see curly brackets, 9/10 you are creating a new scope
//   Best of practice, will not break the code, but its important for reabiability
// */
